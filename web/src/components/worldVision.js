                    Child sponsorship empowers children, their families and communities to
                    help break the cycle of poverty. When you sponsor a child, you provide
                    access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, education and
                    health care. Child sponsorship is available to help children in 44
                    countries.{" "}

                    goals and resources, and work together to find long-term solutions to
                    the challenges they face.

                    lives so that the community continues to meet its goals. As more
                    community members get involved, the community takes increasing
                    ownership of its success.
